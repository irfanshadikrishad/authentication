# authentication

It's a repository to visulize and learn about different levels of database authentication. To use it you need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed in your local machine. And to install the dependensies run `npm install` in CLI. <br> (The database is not connected to the cloud rather in the localhost)

### To go back to the previous versions or levels, checkout to the commited SHA —

- to go back to "Level 1: Username & Password" version of the code —
